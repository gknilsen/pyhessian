** pyhessian

This package `pyhessian' contains the following components:

   pyhessian.py
      A python3 module to estimate Hessian matrices using TensorFlow
      (https://www.tensorflow.org) and NumPy (http://www.numpy.org)
      
   pyhessian_example.py
      An example showing how to apply HessianEstimator on
      a feed-forward neural network TensorFlow model

pyhessian is written in Python3 and depends on the TensorFlow and
NumPy libraries.


pyhessian
~~~~~~~~~
pyhessian is a module used to estimate Hessian matrices of TensorFlow
models. See the accompagnying paper "Efficient Computation of Hessian Matrices
in TensorFlow" found at: http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05559

For models where the full Hessian matrix is too large to fit in memory, 
an alternative can be to use the approximate eigendecomposition of the Hessian matrix. See the module pydeepdelta
(https://github.com/gknilsen/pydeepdelta) described in the paper "On the Delta Method for Uncertainty Approximation in Deep Learning" 
found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00832
