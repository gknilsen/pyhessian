** pyhessian

This package `pyhessian' contains the following components:

   pyhessian.py
      A python3 module to estimate Hessian matrices using TensorFlow
      (https://www.tensorflow.org) and NumPy (http://www.numpy.org)
      
   pyhessian_example.py
      An example showing how to apply HessianEstimator on
      a feed-forward neural network TensorFlow model

pyhessian is written in Python3 and depends on the TensorFlow and
NumPy libraries.
